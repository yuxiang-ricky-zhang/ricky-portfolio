			       As part of the USDOT ITS4US project, the Transportation Data Equity Initiative (TDEI) represents a collaborative effort that I am deeply involved in as a <b>data scientist and machine learning developer </b>at the Paul G. Allen Center for Computer Science and  Engineering, University of Washington. This innovative data infrastructure initiative brings together state transportation departments, transportation service providers, industry stakeholders, and community allies. Our aim is to foster mobility equity through the development of a unified, shared data framework. This framework is designed to fill the gaps in current transportation data, ensuring reliable information availability for travelers. We focus on collecting detailed and accurate data about pedestrian networks, travel environments such as transit facilities, and on-demand travel services, which are particularly crucial for supporting the mobility needs of people with disabilities, the elderly, veterans, and residents in suburban and rural areas.

			       	<br>
			        <br>

					The initiative has three primary objectives:

					1. Develop, refine, and expand data formats for precise mapping of pedestrian routes and transit station pathways, as well as responsive travel services.
					2. Maintain and manage a comprehensive data structure for <b>six U.S. counties over a five-year period</b>.
					3. Introduce various mobility applications and planning tools that showcase the data infrastructure's flexibility and scalability.

					<br>
			        <br>
					Innovative features of this project include the OpenSidewalks project for detailed digital mapping of pedestrian areas and the integration of GTFS-flex and GTFS-pathways data. These tools are vital for describing responsive transit services and mapping transit facilities in a digital format. This work aids in analyzing diverse mobility requirements and contributes to more inclusive urban planning.


					<br>
			        <br>
					One of the key benefits of the TDEI is the enhancement of travel experiences, especially for those with specific accessibility needs. By providing richer data on pedestrian pathways, transit routes, and on-demand transport, we aim to improve accessibility, and mobility equity, and stimulate economic activity in the involved areas. Moreover, this initiative is set to revolutionize urban planning processes by offering detailed pedestrian network data for comprehensive analysis. This data supports informed decision-making about infrastructure investments, promoting active, accessible transportation, and sustainable community development.

					<br>
			        <br>
					<b>At the TRB 2024 conference, I had the opportunity to represent the TDEI group, showcasing our innovative data solutions and engaging with other professionals and researchers in transportation, smart city technology, and urban planning. My presentation focused on the practical applications of our machine learning models in enhancing urban mobility, and I actively participated in discussions that are now shaping our next steps in this exciting project.</b>

		      		Inspecting public pathways for accessibility barriers is crucial for community walkability, safety, and sustainability. Traditional inspection methods, whether conducted by professional surveyors or through crowdsourcing, are often tedious, inconsistent, costly, and difficult to scale. In contrast, modern 'smart city' initiatives focus on applying information technology to improve municipal asset management. However, sidewalks have often been overlooked in these tech-driven improvements, especially compared to roads.
			        <br>
			        <br>
					Addressing this gap, we developed the Open Automated Sidewalks Inspection System (OASIS). <b>This innovative and open-source mapping system runs on edge devices to generate sidewalk network data</b>. OASIS utilizes advancements in neural networks, image sensing, location-based techniques, and compact hardware to segment sidewalks and identify barriers, creating a GIS layer for pedestrian transportation that is invaluable for routing, analysis, and operational reporting.
			        <br>
			        <br>
					We developed a prototype of OASIS that was trained and tested in real-world settings, working alongside human surveyors from local transit pathway review teams. This prototype has demonstrated high accuracy in path mapping and significantly improved the efficiency of surveyor teams in the field. Designed with ease of adoption in mind, OASIS is built to seamlessly integrate with governmental pathway review workflows and ensure data interoperability with public data repositories.
